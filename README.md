# T-Intersection Traffic Controller: Verilog Design and Simulation

## Project Overview
This project presents the design and simulation of a Verilog-based traffic controller for a T-intersection, focused on optimizing traffic flow and ensuring pedestrian safety. The controller manages vehicle movement from three directions, utilizing a two-layer control system to handle traffic complexity even with a single input.

## Features
Traffic Flow Optimization: Directs vehicles efficiently from three sides to reduce congestion.
Two-Layered Control System: Adds a layer of control in one direction, enhancing flow management with a single input.
Pedestrian Safety: Equipped with a pedestrian push button to halt traffic, allowing safe pedestrian crossings.
Verilog Simulation: Simulated in Verilog to validate performance, showing improved management and safety at the intersection.

How It Works
Traffic Management: Controls vehicle movement from three sides, optimizing timing and direction to minimize congestion.
Two-Layer Control: Implements a layered control system in one direction to effectively handle complex traffic flow.
Pedestrian Priority: A pedestrian push button temporarily stops vehicles, ensuring safe crossings for pedestrians.

System Design
Input: Single input signal used to detect traffic or pedestrian needs.
Outputs: Four outputs to control vehicle and pedestrian signals across the intersection.
Control Logic: Designed to handle real-time scenarios with minimal inputs, enhancing simplicity and functionality.
